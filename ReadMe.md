## A Cassette 50 Compo Game ##

This is a 2K ($0801-$1000) memory game.
Written entirely over on my Twitch stream during xmas 2020 for the Cassette 50 Games Charity competition.

You can see all 10 Streams (in full) on my youtube channel, here is the play list : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiOlLd4dhIDCRwsRSrOMVja85TiZkUQus

### Instructions ###

The game is simple, just copy what the computer shows you, the game will progressively get harder and harder as you level up.

I hope you have a large and long short term memory, as this will push that top the limits. The goal is to score as low as possible for the number of levels you have.

Keep your memory in top top condition for this game ;) Good luck!
